Stop letting your materials go to waste. Charisma is a progression overhaul that turns the "useless" / archived items you ignore into power. From new abilities to a new stat, you will develop a natural lust to aquire Charisma.

Charisma is a fully balanced mod created by the same person who created Elemental Hearts, designed for intuitive inclusion into every single modpack without changing pace, and heavily polished for both solo and multiplayer.

I got tired of early game materials becoming trash after 20 minutes. In this mod, every unique Charm you craft permanently increases your world's Charisma Stat. The higher your Charisma, the better your luck, movement speed, and shop prices become. It is an extra stat you actually want.

The Core Loop:
Collect & Craft: Scavenge biomes for unique materials to craft Charms like the Boreal Charm, Ash Wood Charm, and Cactus Charm. Every new discovery boosts your global Charisma stat.

Optimize: Combine your charms into powerful Totems at the Tinkerer's Workbench to save slots and stack effects.

Key Features:
The Charisma Stat: A permanent tracker that rewards you for being a completionist. It boosts your power based on how many unique items you've discovered.

The Salesman NPC: A new Town NPC who respects the grind. Once you start gaining Charisma, he moves in and sells you the base charms you've already found - perfect for multiplayer syncing so you don't have to grind duplicate materials.

Cinematic Experience: Includes custom, polished graphical sequences and a clean UI overlay to track your stats in real-time.

This mod has much more to offer and is still in the early stages. So much is planned for this mod and Charisma will have a bright future ahead of itself.

Install my mod today and watch it evolve in real time!



Changelog:
0.3:


SYSTEMS AND ARCHITECTURE

Implemented `CharismaSplashSystem.cs` to trigger a cinematic intro sequence upon world load, featuring particle effects, screen shake, and animated "Charisma: Enabled" text.
Introduced `CharismaSpawnGlobalNPC.cs` to manage a "Milestone" system that modifies spawn rates for specific NPCs (e.g., Demon Tax Collector, Bound Goblin, Mechanic, Wizard, Skeleton Merchant, Golfer, Stylist, Angler) based on `WorldCharismaCount` thresholds using base-3 and base-7 progression.
Modified `CharismaWorldSystem.cs` to detour `Main.UpdateTime_SpawnTownNPCs`, forcing multiple spawn logic ticks per frame based on calculated charisma milestones to accelerate Town NPC arrival.
Added `CharmCompatibilitySystem.cs` to automatically detect and map incompatible "Parent" and "Child" charms (e.g., preventing a player from equipping a Wood Charm while wearing a Timber Talisman) based on crafting recipes.
Integrated `AutoPublish.ps1` and a GitHub workflow (`release.yml`) to handle automated versioning, tagging, and release generation.
Added `.gitattributes` and `.gitignore` files to the project root for improved source control management.


USER INTERFACE AND CONFIGURATION

Updated `CharismaConfig.cs` with a new `EnableIntroSequence` boolean setting (defaulting to true) to allow users to disable the cinematic splash screen.
Updated `Localization/en-US.hjson` with comprehensive entries for all new items (Rot set, Timber Talisman), buffs, configs, and tooltips.


PLAYER MECHANICS

Overhauled `CharismaPlayer.cs` logic for `PostUpdateMiscEffects` and `ModifyLuck` to iterate through active NPCs within a 2200f distance, scaling movement and luck bonuses based on proximity to up to 3 Town NPCs rather than a raw global check.
Significantly reworked `PumpkinCharm.cs` (and `PumpkinCharmPlayer`) to utilize a `pumpkinCharges` and `pumpkinTimer` system with a 420-tick cooldown, limiting the frequency of bonus damage instead of it being purely random.
Updated `BaseCharm.cs` to utilize the new `CharmCompatibilitySystem` via `CanEquipAccessory`, preventing the equipping of lower-tier charms when a composite charm is already present.


ITEMS AND ACCESSORIES (NEW CONTENT)

Implemented `TimberTalisman.cs`, a master-tier accessory combining Ecotone, Harvest, Verdant, and Rot totems, providing massive stat boosts (+4 defense, +7% crit, +10 HP), light, lava immunity, and special triggers.
Added `AshWoodCharm.cs`: Increases armor penetration by 3, grants 180 ticks of Lava Immunity, and features a chance to trigger an `AshWoodExplosion` on hit with a cooldown.
Added `EbonwoodCharm.cs`: Increases endurance by 3% and physically scales up the player's held item and projectiles by 22% via `EbonwoodCharmGlobalProjectile`.
Added `ShadewoodCharm.cs`: Increases run acceleration and damage by 3%, and adds a Life Steal mechanic (healing based on defense) with a cooldown.
Added `RotTotem.cs`: Combines the effects of the Ash Wood, Ebonwood, and Shadewood charms.


VISUALS AND AUDIO

Added `AshWoodExplosion` projectile (using Solar Whip explosion assets) for the Ash Wood Charm effect.
Implemented `CharismaSplashSystem` visuals including a polished sunburst effect, "spark" and "glow" particles, and dynamic text formation.
Integrated audio cues (`SoundID.MenuTick`, `SoundID.DD2_ExplosiveTrapExplode`) into the splash screen sequence.
Added texture support for all new items: `EnchantedTimberTalisman.png`, `AshWoodCharm.png`, `EbonwoodCharm.png`, `ShadewoodCharm.png`, `RotTotem.png`, and `TimberTalisman.png`.


OTHER

Lots and lots of changes behind the scenes, like updating the mod to GitHub and creating an entire auto publish feature with Actions that compile the source code for easier accessibility.

Updated CharismaGlobalItem.cs with OnCreated and OnPickup hooks to ensure charms are registered in the world system via crafting or collection.
Implemented the Verdant charm set: Mahogany Charm, Bamboo Charm, Glowing Mushroom Charm, and the combined Verdant Totem.
