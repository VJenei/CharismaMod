Current Build: Private Testing Phase

This is a work-in-progress build uploaded exclusively for the internal testing team. Features are currently incomplete, undocumented, and subject to frequent breaking changes.

Testing Notes:

Initial Charisma system implementation is live.

Timber-tier charms (Ecotone and Harvest sets) are available for balance feedback.

Town NPC interaction logic is still in flux.

If you are not an authorized tester, please be aware that this mod is in an unstable state and lacks a formal player guide.
